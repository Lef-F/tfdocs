# tfdocs

This package is autogenerated from the Terraform documentation of each provider.

In the `cmd/` there is the logic to generate the actual documentation of each Provider which are inisde `/providers` (for now just `aws`).

The generated documentation is placed inside a package of the same name of the provider, so `aws/` contains the documentation of all the Resources and DataSources from AWS.
