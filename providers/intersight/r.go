Registered client applications have a set of metadata values associated with their client identifier
at the Intersight authorization server, including the list of valid redirection URIs or a display name.
The meta-data is used to specify how a client application can retrieve a OAuth2 Access Token and subsequently
invoke Intersight API on behalf of this AppRegistration.
To register an OAuth2 application, the following information must be provided.
1) Application name
2) An icon for the application
3) URL to the application's home page
4) A short description of the application
5) A list of redirect URLs
When an AppRegistration is created, a unique OAuth2 clientId is generated and returned in the HTTP response.

					Description: `Clients capable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials.For example, this could be a client implemented on a secure server withrestricted access to the client credentials.To maintain the confidentiality of the OAuth2 credentials, two use cases areconsidered.1) The application is running as a service within Intersight. The application automatically obtains the OAuth2 credentials when the application starts and the credentials are not exposed to the end-user. Because end-users (even account administrators) do not have access the OAuth2 credentials, they cannot take the credentials with them when they leave their organization.2) The application is under the control of a \ trusted\ end-user. For example, the end-user may create a native application running outside Intersight. The application uses OAuth2 credentials to interact with the Intersight API. In that case, the Intersight account administrator may generate OAuth2 credentials with a registered application using \ client_credentials\ grant type. In that case, the end-user is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the OAuth2 credentials. If the end-user leaves the organization, you should revoke the credentials and issue new Oauth2 credentials.Here is a possible workflow for handling OAuth2 tokens.1) User Alice (Intersight Account Administrator) logins to Intersight and deploys an Intersight application that requires an OAuth2 token.2) Intersight automatically deploys the application. The application is assigned a OAuth2 token, possibly linked to Alice. The application must NOT expose the OAuth2 secret to Alice, otherwise Alice would be able to use the token after she leaves the company.3) The application can make API calls to Intersight using its assigned OAuth2 token. For example, the application could make weekly scheduled API calls to Intersight.4) Separately, Alice may also get OAuth2 tokens that she can use to make API calls from the Intersight SDK through the northbound API. In that case, Alice will get the associated OAuth2 secrets, but not the one assigned in step #2.5) Alice leaves the organization. The OAuth2 tokens assigned in step #2 must retain their validity even after Alice has left the organization. Because the OAuth2 secrets were never shared with Alice, there is no risk Alice can reuse the OAuth2 secrets. On the other hand, the OAuth2 tokens assigned in step #4 must be invalidated because Alice had the OAuth2 tokens in her possession.`,
