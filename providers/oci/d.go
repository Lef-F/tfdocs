Example:
  'targetType=ALL'

Additional targetTypes would be available in future releases. Clients should ignore new targetType 
or upgrade to latest version of client SDK to handle new targetType.

This data source provides the list of Detector Recipes in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cloud Guard service.

Returns a list of all Detector Recipes in a compartment

The ListDetectorRecipes operation returns only the detector recipes in ` + "`" + `compartmentId` + "`" + ` passed.
The list does not include any subcompartments of the compartmentId passed.

The parameter ` + "`" + `accessLevel` + "`" + ` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
or indirectly (ACCESSIBLE) (the resource can be in a subcompartment) or to return Not Authorized if
Principal doesn't have access to even one of the child compartments. This is valid only when
` + "`" + `compartmentIdInSubtree` + "`" + ` is set to ` + "`" + `true` + "`" + `.

The parameter ` + "`" + `compartmentIdInSubtree` + "`" + ` applies when you perform ListDetectorRecipes on the
` + "`" + `compartmentId` + "`" + ` passed and when it is set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
set the parameter ` + "`" + `compartmentIdInSubtree` + "`" + ` to true and ` + "`" + `accessLevel` + "`" + ` to ACCESSIBLE.

			Description: `
This data source provides the list of Responder Recipes in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cloud Guard service.

Returns a list of all ResponderRecipes in a compartment
The ListResponderRecipe operation returns only the targets in ` + "`" + `compartmentId` + "`" + ` passed.
The list does not include any subcompartments of the compartmentId passed.

The parameter ` + "`" + `accessLevel` + "`" + ` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
or indirectly (ACCESSIBLE) (the resource can be in a subcompartment) or to return Not Authorized if
Principal doesn't have access to even one of the child compartments. This is valid only when
` + "`" + `compartmentIdInSubtree` + "`" + ` is set to ` + "`" + `true` + "`" + `.

The parameter ` + "`" + `compartmentIdInSubtree` + "`" + ` applies when you perform ListResponderRecipe on the
` + "`" + `compartmentId` + "`" + ` passed and when it is set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
set the parameter ` + "`" + `compartmentIdInSubtree` + "`" + ` to true and ` + "`" + `accessLevel` + "`" + ` to ACCESSIBLE.

This data source provides the list of Targets in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cloud Guard service.

Returns a list of all Targets in a compartment
The ListTargets operation returns only the targets in ` + "`" + `compartmentId` + "`" + ` passed.
The list does not include any subcompartments of the compartmentId passed.

The parameter ` + "`" + `accessLevel` + "`" + ` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
or indirectly (ACCESSIBLE) (the resource can be in a subcompartment) or to return Not Authorized if
Principal doesn't have access to even one of the child compartments. This is valid only when
` + "`" + `compartmentIdInSubtree` + "`" + ` is set to ` + "`" + `true` + "`" + `.

The parameter ` + "`" + `compartmentIdInSubtree` + "`" + ` applies when you perform ListTargets on the
` + "`" + `compartmentId` + "`" + ` passed and when it is set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
set the parameter ` + "`" + `compartmentIdInSubtree` + "`" + ` to true and ` + "`" + `accessLevel` + "`" + ` to ACCESSIBLE.

This data source provides the list of Private Ips in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Lists the [PrivateIp](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PrivateIp/) objects based
on one of these filters:

  - Subnet OCID.
  - VNIC OCID.
  - Both private IP address and subnet OCID: This lets
  you get a ` + "`" + `privateIP` + "`" + ` object based on its private IP
  address (for example, 10.0.3.3) and not its OCID. For comparison,
  [GetPrivateIp](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PrivateIp/GetPrivateIp)
  requires the OCID.

If you're listing all the private IPs associated with a given subnet
or VNIC, the response includes both primary and secondary private IPs.

If you are an Oracle Cloud VMware Solution customer and have VLANs
in your VCN, you can filter the list by VLAN OCID. See [Vlan](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Vlan).

each resource type and specify the compartment's OCID as a query parameter in the request. For example,
call the [ListInstances](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Instance/ListInstances) operation in the Cloud Compute

This data source provides details about a specific Listing resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace service.

Gets detailed information about a listing, including the listing's name, version, description, and
resources.

If you plan to launch an instance from an image listing, you must first subscribe to the listing. When
you launch the instance, you also need to provide the image ID of the listing resource version that you want.

Subscribing to the listing requires you to first get a signature from the terms of use agreement for the
listing resource version. To get the signature, issue a [GetAppCatalogListingAgreements](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements/GetAppCatalogListingAgreements) API call.
The [AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements) object, including
its signature, is returned in the response. With the signature for the terms of use agreement for the desired
listing resource version, create a subscription by issuing a
[CreateAppCatalogSubscription](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogSubscription/CreateAppCatalogSubscription) API call.

To get the image ID to launch an instance, issue a [GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersion/GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion) API call.
Lastly, to launch the instance, use the image ID of the listing resource version to issue a [LaunchInstance](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Instance/LaunchInstance) API call.

			Description: `
This data source provides the list of Listings in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace service.

Gets a list of listings from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace by searching keywords and
filtering according to listing attributes.

If you plan to launch an instance from an image listing, you must first subscribe to the listing. When
you launch the instance, you also need to provide the image ID of the listing resource version that you want.

Subscribing to the listing requires you to first get a signature from the terms of use agreement for the
listing resource version. To get the signature, issue a [GetAppCatalogListingAgreements](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements/GetAppCatalogListingAgreements) API call.
The [AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements) object, including
its signature, is returned in the response. With the signature for the terms of use agreement for the desired
listing resource version, create a subscription by issuing a
[CreateAppCatalogSubscription](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogSubscription/CreateAppCatalogSubscription) API call.

To get the image ID to launch an instance, issue a [GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersion/GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion) API call.
Lastly, to launch the instance, use the image ID of the listing resource version to issue a [LaunchInstance](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Instance/LaunchInstance) API call.
