The default iPXE script connects to the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network-boot from the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot.

If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots; however, you should be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots; not only after the initial LaunchInstance call. The default iPXE script connects to the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network-boot from the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot.

Lists the [PublicIp](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PublicIp/) objects

To list your reserved public IPs:
  * Set ` + "`" + `scope` + "`" + ` = ` + "`" + `REGION` + "`" + `  (required)
  * Leave the ` + "`" + `availabilityDomain` + "`" + ` parameter empty
  * Set ` + "`" + `lifetime` + "`" + ` = ` + "`" + `RESERVED` + "`" + `

To list the ephemeral public IPs assigned to a regional entity such as a NAT gateway:
  * Set ` + "`" + `scope` + "`" + ` = ` + "`" + `REGION` + "`" + `  (required)
  * Leave the ` + "`" + `availabilityDomain` + "`" + ` parameter empty
  * Set ` + "`" + `lifetime` + "`" + ` = ` + "`" + `EPHEMERAL` + "`" + `

To list the ephemeral public IPs assigned to private IPs:
  * Set ` + "`" + `scope` + "`" + ` = ` + "`" + `AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN` + "`" + ` (required)
  * Set the ` + "`" + `availabilityDomain` + "`" + ` parameter to the desired availability domain (required)
  * Set ` + "`" + `lifetime` + "`" + ` = ` + "`" + `EPHEMERAL` + "`" + `

**Note:** An ephemeral public IP assigned to a private IP
is always in the same availability domain and compartment as the private IP.

			Description: `
This data source provides the list of Compartments in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity service.

Lists the compartments in a specified compartment. The members of the list
returned depends on the values set for several parameters.

With the exception of the tenancy (root compartment), the ListCompartments operation
returns only the first-level child compartments in the parent compartment specified in
` + "`" + `compartmentId` + "`" + `. The list does not include any subcompartments of the child
compartments (grandchildren).

The parameter ` + "`" + `accessLevel` + "`" + ` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
or indirectly (the resource can be in a subcompartment).

The parameter ` + "`" + `compartmentIdInSubtree` + "`" + ` applies only when you perform ListCompartments on the
tenancy (root compartment). When set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
set the parameter ` + "`" + `compartmentIdInSubtree` + "`" + ` to true and ` + "`" + `accessLevel` + "`" + ` to ANY.

(see [Where to Get the Tenancy's OCID and User's OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five)).
You must also then filter the list in one of these ways:

- You can limit the results to just the memberships for a given user by specifying a ` + "`" + `userId` + "`" + `.
- Similarly, you can limit the results to just the memberships for a given group by specifying a ` + "`" + `groupId` + "`" + `.
- You can set both the ` + "`" + `userId` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `groupId` + "`" + ` to determine if the specified user is in the specified group.
If the answer is no, the response is an empty list.
- Although` + "`" + `userId` + "`" + ` and ` + "`" + `groupId` + "`" + ` are not individually required, you must set one of them.

If you plan to launch an instance from an image listing, you must first subscribe to the listing. When
you launch the instance, you also need to provide the image ID of the listing resource version that you want.

Subscribing to the listing requires you to first get a signature from the terms of use agreement for the
listing resource version. To get the signature, issue a [GetAppCatalogListingAgreements](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements/GetAppCatalogListingAgreements) API call.
The [AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements) object, including
its signature, is returned in the response. With the signature for the terms of use agreement for the desired
listing resource version, create a subscription by issuing a
[CreateAppCatalogSubscription](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogSubscription/CreateAppCatalogSubscription) API call.

To get the image ID to launch an instance, issue a [GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersion/GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion) API call.
Lastly, to launch the instance, use the image ID of the listing resource version to issue a [LaunchInstance](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Instance/LaunchInstance) API call.

			Description: `
This data source provides the list of Listings in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace service.

Gets a list of listings from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace by searching keywords and
filtering according to listing attributes.

If you plan to launch an instance from an image listing, you must first subscribe to the listing. When
you launch the instance, you also need to provide the image ID of the listing resource version that you want.

Subscribing to the listing requires you to first get a signature from the terms of use agreement for the
listing resource version. To get the signature, issue a [GetAppCatalogListingAgreements](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements/GetAppCatalogListingAgreements) API call.
The [AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements) object, including
its signature, is returned in the response. With the signature for the terms of use agreement for the desired
listing resource version, create a subscription by issuing a
[CreateAppCatalogSubscription](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogSubscription/CreateAppCatalogSubscription) API call.

To get the image ID to launch an instance, issue a [GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersion/GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion) API call.
Lastly, to launch the instance, use the image ID of the listing resource version to issue a [LaunchInstance](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Instance/LaunchInstance) API call.

The Alarms feature of the Monitoring service interprets results for each returned time series as Boolean values, where zero represents false and a non-zero value represents true. A true value means that the trigger rule condition has been met. The query must specify a metric, statistic, interval, and trigger rule (threshold or absence). Supported values for interval: ` + "`" + `1m` + "`" + `-` + "`" + `60m` + "`" + ` (also ` + "`" + `1h` + "`" + `). You can optionally specify dimensions and grouping functions. Supported grouping functions: ` + "`" + `grouping()` + "`" + `, ` + "`" + `groupBy()` + "`" + `. For details about Monitoring Query Language (MQL), see [Monitoring Query Language (MQL) Reference](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Reference/mql.htm). For available dimensions, review the metric definition for the supported service. See [Supported Services](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#SupportedServices). Example of threshold alarm: ----- CpuUtilization[1m]{availabilityDomain="cumS:PHX-AD-1"}.groupBy(availabilityDomain).percentile(0.9) > 85 ----- Example of absence alarm: ----- CpuUtilization[1m]{availabilityDomain="cumS:PHX-AD-1"}.absent() -----`,
