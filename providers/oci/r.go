If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots; however, you should be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots; not only after the initial LaunchInstance call. The default iPXE script connects to the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network-boot from the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot.

Session persistence enables the Load Balancing service to direct all requests that originate from a single logical client to a single backend web server. For more information, see [Session Persistence](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Balance/Reference/sessionpersistence.htm). When you configure LB cookie stickiness, the load balancer inserts a cookie into the response. The parameters configured in the cookie enable session stickiness. This method is useful when you have applications and Web backend services that cannot generate their own cookies. Path route rules take precedence to determine the target backend server. The load balancer verifies that session stickiness is enabled for the backend server and that the cookie configuration (domain, path, and cookie hash) is valid for the target. The system ignores invalid cookies. To disable LB cookie stickiness on a running load balancer, use the [UpdateBackendSet](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/loadbalancer/20170115/BackendSet/UpdateBackendSet) operation and specify ` + "`" + `null` + "`" + ` for the ` + "`" + `LBCookieSessionPersistenceConfigurationDetails` + "`" + ` object.

There is no default value for this attribute. If you do not specify a value, the load balancer does not include the ` + "`" + `Max-Age` + "`" + ` attribute in the ` + "`" + `Set-cookie` + "`" + ` header.
