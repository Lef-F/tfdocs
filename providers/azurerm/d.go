~> **Note:** [The Azure DNS API has a throttle limit of 500 read (GET) operations per 5 minutes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/request-limits-and-throttling#network-throttling) - whilst the default read timeouts will work for most cases - in larger configurations you may need to set a larger [read timeout](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) then the default 5min. Although, we'd generally recommend that you split the resources out into smaller Terraform configurations to avoid the problem entirely.
